# Sails &emsp;

Sails is a library for bringing your experience of writing applications utilizing
[Gear Protocol](https://gear-tech.io/) to the next level of simplicity and
clarity. It deals with things like:
- eliminating
the necessity of writing some low-level boilerplate code and letting you to stay
focused on your bussiness problem
- generated [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) file for
your application
- generated client allowing to interact with your application from code written in
different languages and executed in different runtimes

---

## Getting started

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
sails-rtl = { git = "https://github.com/gear-tech/sails" }
gstd = { git = "https://github.com/gear-tech/gear", features = ["debug"] }
```

And then:

```rust
#![no_std]

use gstd::debug;
use sails_rtl::{gstd::gservice, prelude::*};

struct MyPing;

#[gservice]
impl MyPing {
    pub const fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }

    pub async fn ping(&mut self) -> bool {
        debug!("Ping called");
        true
    }
}

#[derive(Default)]
struct MyProgram;

#[gprogram]
impl MyProgram {
    #[groute("ping")]
    pub fn ping_svc(&self) -> MyPing {
        MyPing::new()
    }
}
```

## Details

The entire idea of the [Gear Protocol](https://gear-tech.io/) is based on the
asynchronous version of the [Request-Response Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response).
On-chain applications loaded onto Gear-based network receive and handle messages from the
other on-chain or off-chain applications. Both can be treated as external consumers
of services provided by your application, and the latter can represent ordinary people
interacting with the network.

### Application

Sails architecture for applications is based on a few key concepts.
<br/>

The first one is *__service__* which is represented by an impl of some Rust struct
marked with the `#[gservice]` attribute. The service main responsibility is
implementing some aspect of application business logic. A set of its __public__
methods defined by the impl is essentially a set of remote calls the service exposes
to external consumers. Each such method working over a `&mut self` is treated as
a command changing some state, whereas each method working over a `&self` is
treated as a query keeping everything unchanged and returning some data. Both
types of methods can accept some parameters passed by a client and can be synchronous
or asynchronous. All the other service's methods and associated functions are treated
as implementation details and ignored. The code generated behind the service by the
`#[gservice]` attribute decodes an incoming request message and dispatches it to the
appropriate method based on the method's name. On the method's completion, its result
is encoded and returned as a response to a caller.

```rust
#[gservice]
impl MyService {
    // This is a command
    pub fn do_something(&mut self, p1: u32, p2: String) -> &'static [u8] {
        ...
    }

    // This is a query
    pub fn some_value(&self, p1: Option<bool>) -> String {
        ...
    }
}
```

<br/>

The second key concept is *__program__* which is similarly to the service represented
by an impl of some Rust struct marked with the `#[gprogram]` attribute. The program
main responsibility is hosting one or more services and exposing them to the external
consumers. A set of its __public__ associated functions returning `Self` are
treated as application constructors. These functions can accept some parameters
passed by a client and can be synchronous or asynchronous. One of them will be called
once per application lifetime when the application is loaded onto the network.
A set of program's __public__ methods working over `&self` and having no other parameters
are treated as exposed service constructors and are called each time when an incoming
request message needs be dispatched to a selected service. All the other methods and
associated functions are treated as implementation details and ignored. The code
generated behind the program by the `#[gprogram]` attribute receives an incoming request
message from the network, decodes it and dispatches it to a matching service for actual
processing. After that, the result is encoded and returned as a response to a caller.
Only one program is allowed per application.

```rust
#[gprogram]
impl MyProgram {
    // Application constructor
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        ...
    }

    // Yet another application constructor
    pub fn from_u32(p1: u32) -> Self {
        ...
    }

    // Service constructor
    pub fn ping_svc(&self) -> MyPing {
        ...
    }
}
```

<br/>

And the final key concept is message *__routing__*. This concept doesn't have a
mandatory representation in code, but can be altered by using the `#[groute]`
attribute applied to those public methods and associated functions described above.
The concept itself is about rules for dispatching an incoming request message to
a specific service's method using service and method names. By default, every
service exposed via program is exposed using the name of the service constructor
method converted into *PascalCase*. For example:

```rust
#[gprogram]
impl MyProgram {
    // The `MyPing` service is exposed as `PingSvc`
    pub fn ping_svc(&self) -> MyPing {
        ...
    }
}
```

This behavior can be changed by applying the `#[groute]` attribute:

```rust
#[gprogram]
impl MyProgram {
    // The `MyPing` service is exposed as `Ping`
    #[groute("ping")] // The specified name will be converted into PascalCase
    pub fn ping_svc(&self) -> MyPing {
        ...
    }
}
```

The same rules are applicable to service method names:

```rust
#[gservice]
impl MyPing {
    // The `do_ping` method is exposed as `Ping`
    #[groute("ping")]
    pub fn do_ping(&mut self) {
        ...
    }

    // The `ping_count` method is exposed as `PingCount`
    pub fn ping_count(&self) -> u64 {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Events

Sails provides a way to emit events from your application while it processes some
commands. The event is a mean of notifying off-chain subscribers about some changes
happened to the application state. In Sails, events are configured and emitted on
a per service basis via the `events` argument of the `#[gservice]` attribute. They
are represented by a Rust enum where each variant is a separate event with its optional
data. As soon as service declares it emits some events, the `#[gservice]` attribute
generates the `notify_on` service method which can be called by the service to emit
an event. For example:

```rust
fn counter_mut() -> &'static mut u32 {
    static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;
    unsafe { &mut COUNTER }
}

struct MyCounter;

#[derive(Encode, TypeInfo)]
enum MyCounterEvent {
    Incremented(u32),
}

#[gservice(events = MyCounterEvent)]
impl MyCounter {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }

    pub fn increment(&mut self) {
        *counter_mut() += 1;
        self.notify_on(MyCounterEvent::Incremented(*counter_mut())).unwrap();
    }

    // Generated by the `#[gservice]` attribute
    fn notify_on(&mut self, event: MyCounterEvent) -> Result<()> {
        ...
    }
}
```

It is worth mentioning that under the hood events utilize the same mechanism as
any other message sending in Gear Protocol. This implies that the event is published
only on successful completion of the command which emitted it.

You can find more details in the [Examples](#examples) section.

### Service Extending (Mixins)

Another feature Sails can boast of is the ability to extend (mixin) existing services.
Say there are service `A` and service `B`, and you want their functionality to be exposed
as a part of your new service `C`. You can achieve this by using the `extends` argument of
the `#[gservice]` attribute. You can not only mix the functionality in but also override
some methods of the original services. For example:

```rust
struct MyServiceA;

#[gservice]
impl MyServiceA {
    pub fn do_a(&mut self) {
        ...
    }
}

struct MyServiceB;

#[gservice]
impl MyServiceB {
    pub fn do_b(&mut self) {
        ...
    }
}

struct MyServiceC;

#[gservice(extends = [MyServiceA, MyServiceB])]
impl MyServiceC {
    // New method
    pub fn do_c(&mut self) {
        ...
    }

    // Overridden method from MyServiceA
    pub fn do_a(&mut self) {
        ...
    }

    // do_b from MyServiceB will exposed due to the extends argument
}
```

You can find more details in the [Examples](#examples) section.

### Payload Encoding

An application written with Sails uses [SCALE Codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec) to encode/decode data
at its base.
<br/>

Every incoming request message is expected to have the following format:
<br/>

__|__ *SCALE encoded service name* __|__ *SCALE encoded method name* __|__ *SCALE encoded parameters* __|__
<br/>

Every outgoing response message has the following format:
<br/>

__|__ *SCALE encoded service name* __|__ *SCALE encoded method name* __|__ *SCALE encoded result* __|__
<br/>

Every outgoing event message has the following format:
<br/>

__|__ *SCALE encoded service name* __|__ *SCALE encoded event data* __|__
<br/>

### Client

Having applications without a way to interact with them is not very useful. Sails
provides a number of options to do this. First of all, it doesn't eliminate the option
of doing this in fully manual mode using means provided by the Gear Protocol - whether
you want to use a set of the `msg::send` functions from the `gstd` crate for interacting
from one application with another, or you want to use functionality provided by the `gclient`
crate for interacting from off-chain code with an on-chain application, or [TDB about JS],
all you need to do is to compose byte payload according to the layout outlined in the
[Payload Encoding](#payload-encoding) section and send it to an application. Thanks to the
generated IDL, Sails provides a way to interact with your application using generated clients
having interface similar to the one exposed by your application. Currently Sails can generate
client code for Rust and TypeScript.

<br/>

When it comes to Rust, there are 2 options:
- use generated code which can encode and decode byte payload for you, and you can keep
  using functions sending raw bytes
- use fully generated code which can interact with your application in an RPC style

Say you have an application which exposes a service `MyService` with a command `do_something`:

```rust
struct Ouput {
    m1: u32,
    m2: String,
}

#[gservice]
impl MyService {
    pub fn do_something(&mut self, p1: u32, p2: String) -> Output {
        ...
    }
}

#[gprogram]
impl MyProgram {
    pub fn my_service(&self) -> MyService {
        MyService::new()
    }
}
```

Then in a client application provided the code generation happens in Rust build script,
you can use the generated code like this (option 1):

```rust
include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/my_service.rs"));

fn some_client_code() {
    let call_payload = my_service_io::DoSomething::encode_call(42, "Hello".to_string());
    let reply_bytes = gstd::msg::send_bytes_for_reply(target_app_id, call_payload, 0, 0).await.unwrap();
    let reply = my_service_io::DoSomething::decode_reply(&reply_bytes).unwrap();
    let m1 = reply.m1;
    let m2 = reply.m2;
}
```

Or like this (option 2):

```rust
include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/my_service.rs"));

fn some_client_code() {
    let mut my_service = MyService::new(remoting); // remoting is an abstraction provided by Sails
    let reply_ticket = client.do_something(42, "Hello".to_string())
        .with_reply_deposit(42)
        .publish(target_app_id)
        .await.unwrap();
    let reply = reply_ticket.reply().await.unwrap();
    let m1 = reply.m1;
    let m2 = reply.m2;
}
```

The second option provides you with an option to have your code testable as the generated
code depends on the trait which can be easily mocked.
